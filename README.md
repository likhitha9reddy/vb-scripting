### Simple Bot Script
Branch containing a simple bot using VB Scripting, HTML and PHP. The script file creates an application object and randomly inputs emails (random_numbers@something.com) with same password. This action repeats thrice. A html form was created with email and password as inputs along with a submit button. Upon clicking the submit button, a php file should echo the user input.

Following tips might be helpful in running the script and minimizing the errors:
1. The script was tested in a Windows 10 virtual environment with XAMPP setup. 
2. Script and other dependecy files are placed in (Drive):\xampp\htdocs\php\vb_scripts - path depends on respective XAMPP installation
3. Internet Explorer browser was used where 'Enable Protected Mode' had to be disabled. (IE Tools -> Internet Options -> Security -> Uncheck 'Enable Protected Mode'.
4. Firewalls were disabled until the script was tested.
